# Client Management System 🧑‍💼

This project is a training-based **Angular application** built to practice and demonstrate everything I’ve learned so far in Angular development.

It includes real-world concepts like:

- ✅ Standalone Components
- ✅ Reactive Forms
- ✅ Routing with Guards
- ✅ HTTP Interceptor (Authorization Header)
- ✅ Angular Material UI (MatTable, Inputs, Buttons)
- ✅ BehaviorSubject for state syncing
- ✅ Centralized state management using custom services
- ✅ Light/Dark Theme switching using CSS Variables

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Angular 16+ with Standalone APIs
- Angular Material
- SCSS for styling
- CSS Variables for theming
- LocalStorage for state persistence
